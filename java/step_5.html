  <h3>Play</h3>
  <p>Now we need to write the <em>play</em> endpoint, which is the fun part!</p>
  <p>With this endpoint pokerwars will be able to ask Phil what will be your poker bot next move.
    Let's keep it simple for now, and say that you want to write a super boring poker bot, who will
    always fold. The real Phil would not be very happy, but who cares.</p>
  <p>We prepared the <em>PokerAction</em> object response for you, now try to write the code to
    always fold.</p>
  <p class="exercise">HINT: Use the <em>PokerAction</em> object similarly as the <em>Pong</em>
    object. In this case, you need to specify what action you want to do, and now, remember, we want
    to always fold.</p>
