  <p>Welcome to pokerwars! In this tutorial you will learn how to build a simple bot. Let's get
    started!</p>
  <h2>The starter bots</h2>
  <p>In our <a href="https://github.com/pokerwars" target="_blank">GitHub page</a> you can find
    starter bots for a number of languages. These are very simple versions of pre-built bots. You
    are not limited to those, you can use any programming language you want as long as it's capable
    of sending and receiving HTTP requests.
  </p>
  <p>For Javascript, our starter project is <a
      href="https://github.com/pokerwars/pokerwars.io-starterbot-javascript"
      target="_blank">here</a>. In this tutorial we will build that same starter bot, step by step.
    At the end, you will get an understanding of the game and the pokerwars platform, and you'll
    have a working bot ready, which you can modify to implement your own unique strategy. How cool
    is that!
