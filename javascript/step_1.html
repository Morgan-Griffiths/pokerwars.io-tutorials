    <h2>The starter projects</h2>
    <p>In our GitHub repository you can find starter projects for a number of languages. You are not limited to those,
        you can use any programming language you want as long as it's capable of sending and receiving HTTP requests.
    </p>
    <p>For Javascript, our starter project is <a href="https://github.com/pokerwars/pokerwars.io-starterbot-javascript"
            target="_blank">here</a>. We will build that same starter bot now step by step. At the end, you will get
        an understanding of the game and the platform, and a working bot ready for you to implement your own unique
        strategy. How cool is that!
