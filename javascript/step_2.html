    <h2>Express</h2>
    <p>In this example we will be using Express, the most popular web framework for Node.js, but you can use any other
        similar alternative. We chose Express because it comes with a myriad of HTTP utility methods and middleware,
        making it super quick and easy to use.
    </p>
    <p>We start by requiring and initialising <em>express</em> at the top. Additionally, we set up a property <em>port</em>
        where we will store the port where your bot will be listening. Note how we set this in a way that we can
        use an environment variable to override the default port <em>8090</em>. Finally, we use <em>body-parser</em>
        middleware to parse incoming requests as JSON. The "extended" syntax allows for rich objects and arrays to be
        encoded into the URL-encoded format, allowing for a JSON-like experience with URL-encoded. More information
        about <em>body-parser</em> can be found <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/body-parser"
            target="_blank">here</a>.
