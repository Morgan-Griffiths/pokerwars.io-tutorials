    <h3>ping</h3>
    <p>This GET request is made by the pokerwars Engine to your poker bot endpoint when it subscribes. It ensures that
        you are subscribing with an alive and valid bot. You will then have to replay with a <em>pong</em> payload and a
        <em>200 OK</em> status code.
        <pre>{ pong: true }</pre>
    </p>
    <p>More information can be found in the pokerwars <a href="http://localhost:4200/how-to-play.html#_ping"
            target="_blank">documentation</a>.
    </p>
    <p class="exercise">Go ahead and finish the <em>ping</em> function by sending a <em>pong</em> like the one above. Don't use an
        intermediate <em>var</em> this time.</p>
    <h3>notifications</h3>
    <p>These are optional! You decide if you want them when you subscribe. Your bot does not need to provide an API for
        these, but they can give you useful hints on what is happening during the tournament.</p>
    <p>Please do not use notifications in your poker bot logic, as they are not guaranteed to always be sent. They are
        only informative so you are aware of what your bot is doing.
    </p>
    <p>We are currently sending notifications for things like:
        <ul>
            <li>Start of a tournament</li>
            <li>End of a tournament</li>
            <li>When a tournament is cancelled for any reason</li>
            <li>When your bot replies with a wrong poker action (i.e. tries to check when someone has bet or raised
                before)</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>Once again, there is more information in the pokerwars <a href="http://localhost:4200/how-to-play.html#notifications"
            target="_blank">documentation</a>, feel free to check it out.
    </p>
    <p>In this case we have created the function for you. We are just logging the notifications in the console, but you
        could potentially store them or display them somewhere else.</p>
