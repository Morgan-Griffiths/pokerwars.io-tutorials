    <h3>play</h3>
    <p>Let's look at the play function first. Here in the <i>body</i> of the request we have an object called
        <b>gameContext</b>. This contains all the information about the tournament e.g. the blinds, the turn, the cards
        on the table and the different players and their chips and bets. It will also contain information about your own
        cards.

    <p>
        With this information you will have to decide what to do next.
    </p>
    <p>Remember, the <i>play</i> endpoint will be called by the Pokerwars Engine. It will POST this data to you, and
        you must respond with your next action. We do this by returning a <i>200 OK</i> status code with a JSON payload
        that looks like this:
        <pre>
        {
            action: 'SOME_ACTION'
        }</pre>
        There a multiple actions available, check the Pokerwars <a href="http://localhost:4200/how-to-play.html#_play"
            target="_blank">documentation</a> for more information.
    </p>
    <p>In Express, we send a response by assigning a status code and a payload directly in the middleware function like
        this.
        <pre>res.status(200).send(SOME_PAYLOAD);</pre>
    </p>
    <p class="exercise">Go ahead and create a response with a payload that always do <b>'fold'</b>. Store the payload in a <i>var</i> called
        <b>nextMove</b>. HINT - In Javascript we can assign a JSON object directly to a <i>var</i> like this:
        <pre>var a = { foo: 'bar' }</pre>
    </p>
</div>
