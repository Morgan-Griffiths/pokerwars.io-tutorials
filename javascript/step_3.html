    <h2>Routes and functions</h2>
    <p>Next we need to declare some routes. These are endpoints that our application will be exposing when it's up and
        running, and that will be called by the Pokerwars Engine! This Engine is where all the magic happens. It keeps
        track of all the tournaments and calls each bot for the next action. For now, let's not worry about that and
        let's focus on how to create routes.
    </p>
    <p>In Express, we can create a new route using
        <i>app.route()</i>. In the code, we went ahead and created a route for the <i>play</i> action for you. This
        is the endpoint the Engine will call (with a POST request) during the tournament to ask you for your next action
        when your bot is playing. The endpoint itself needs to follow a convention where we have
        <i>/pokerwars.io/</i> followed by the name of something the Engine understands, in this case
        <i>play</i>. Once that endpoint is called, our application will call a function named
        <i>play()</i> passing the HTTP request and HTTP response objects.</p>
    <pre>var play = function (req, res) {};</pre>
    <p>For now we'll leave this <i>play</i> function empty. In the next steps we'll see how it works.</p>
    <p>In addition to <i>play</i> there are another two endpoints the game requires you to implement:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <i>ping</i>: used by the Engine when your bot subscribes to verify that is alive and responding.
        </li>
        <li>
            <i>notifications</i>: this one is optional, you decide if you want them when you subscribe. Your bot
            does not need to necessarily provide an endpoint for these, but they can give you useful hints on what
            is happening during the tournaments. <b>Please do not use notifications in your bot logic, as they are
            not guaranteed to always be sent. They are only informative so you are aware of what your bot is
            doing.</b>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p class="exercise">Go ahead and create similar routes and functions for <b><i>ping</i></b> and
        <b><i>notifications</i></b>. The ping route needs to be GET, and the notifications route needs to be POST.
    </p>
    <p><b>HINT: </b> create ping first and notifications second for the validation to pass.</p>
