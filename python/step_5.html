    <h2>Our first method</h2>
    <p>
        We are not going to add the first method with some basic logic. We start simple, with the <em>ping</em> endpoint.
        The desired behaviour is to receive a call from the pokerwars server, log it, and reply with a <em>pong</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
        First we need to create a method linked to the <em>ping</em> endpoint. The syntax is <em>def</em>
        keyword followed by the method name and the parameter (none at the moment) in brackets and colon symbol.
    </p>
    <p>
        Then inside the method we are going to log the call: we are using the <em>printl</em> command with the following
        message:
    </p>
    <pre>'Received ping from pokerwars.io, responding with a pong'</pre>
    <p>
        And finally the interesting part, replying back with a pong JSON content. We are doing that setting the
        <em>response.content_type</em> to <em>'application/json'</em> and invoking the <em>return</em> command with
        the JSON structure that we want to send back. E.g.
    </p>
    <pre>return {"pong": True}</pre>

        Now it's your turn, put together the 3 steps we described before, and you should be able to proceed to the next
        level.
